1. Devise an experiment to verify that the list index operator is *O(1)*

2. Devise an experiment to verify that get item and set item are *O(1)* for dictionaries.

3. Devise an experiment that compares the performance of the ```del``` operator on lists and dictionaries.

4. Given a list of numbers in random order, write an algorithm that works in *O(nlog(n))* to find the kth smallest number in the list.

5. Can you improve the algorithm from the previous problem to be linear? Explain.
